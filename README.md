# Blogr landing page

![Design preview for the Blogr landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Project Log
I'd never try the hamburger menu, so it was a challenge for me, but i've managed to handle it well.
The desktop design was easy, but mobile design was exact opposite of that!
Background pics was unstable in different sizes and screens, but I already learned a lot trying to fix them and they are now fully responsive!
* I had to create some elements multiple times to show them in desktop/mobile in different places, which i'm absolutely sure it's bad practice, but i'm trying to be better at these kinda things.

## Note to self
I should add more features and more pages to this landing page, make it more dynamic and etc.
Don't forget about that.
